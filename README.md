# new_calendar_system
I was bored over winter break of 2nd year, so I decided to work on a project entirely on my phone.

I used my vague knowledge of number theory to design a prime factorization algorithm, used that to split up the number of seconds in the average number of days in a Gregorian year (365.2425), and recombined prime factors as I saw fit to create a new calendar system. I had planned to switch to that system, creating a suite of conversion apps and simple clocks to keep track of time, but that never came to fruition. Maybe later. Instead, it serves a proof of concept.
